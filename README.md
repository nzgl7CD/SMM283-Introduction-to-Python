<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

</br>

## About the Project

The project is developed as a response to the requirments of the coursework given by the professor.  

### Refactored backend

The backend itself offered a great amount of more advanced components.



### Tests for Project 

The application is mostly tested from the project. As I mentioned earlier are several unit tests written as well as a detailed cypress test. The whole code is therefore well covered already, with above 90% jest coverage. I had to rewrite the backend util tests as they met some issues related to the new TypeScript utils they are testing. I also did a few changes to make the tests pointier. I did want to refactor the tests as well but after discussing this with a student assistant did, we conclude that it would be sort of a wate of time as I already have proven my refactoring skills.

#### Review

Reviews for a given movie are accessible by anyone visiting the site. These can be viewed by visiting a single movie as mentioned previously. When a user is logged in, the user can publish a new review and the form gets visible. To publish a review, the client sends the jwt token as an authorization header which is validated in the backend. If everything works as expected, the review is successfully created and can be viewed on the detailed movie page. If invalid token is given, the app restricts the user from publishing the review.

### Testing


#### Backend Testing

As for testing for backend modules would the most essential parts be covered by testing the util folder (.\backend\util) as it contains validators for authorization, registration and login and creating of movie queries. The testing covers the parts that throw errors when illegal arguments are set. We have also tested if legal arguments pass through and make the function return what itâ€™s supposed to.
